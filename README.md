Examining, analyzing, and creating useful summaries of data




In general, data profiling applications analyze a database by organizing and collecting information about it. This involves data profiling techniques such as column profiling, cross-column profiling, and cross-table profiling. Almost all of these profiling techniques can be categorized in one of three ways:

Structure discovery — Structure discovery (or analysis) helps determine whether your data is consistent and formatted correctly. It uses basic statistics to provide information about the validity of data.
Content discovery — Content discovery focuses on data quality. Data needs to be processed for formatting and standardization, and then properly integrated with existing data in a timely and efficient manner. For example, if a street address or phone number is incorrectly formatted it could mean that certain customers can’t be reached, or a delivery is misplaced.
Relationship discovery — Relationship discovery identifies connections between different datasets.
